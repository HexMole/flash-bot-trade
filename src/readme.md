### Usage

Required Preparation:

1. Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if it's not already installed.
2. Deploy a sandwich contract from the [contracts](../contracts/) directory, or re-use an existing one.
3. Create a `.env` file and set the required variables, referencing the below environment variables. (NOTE: we've added `.env` and `.env.prod` to the `.gitignore` file, so you don't accidentally commit your secrets to the repo. All other secret commits are on you. Exercise caution.)
